    "# Saltwater Intrusion Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "A growing coastal city is interested in developing a wellfield in order to provide potable drinking water to its residents.  You have been contracted by the city to perform a numerical analysis to determine the effects of groundwater withdrawals on the position of the saltwater interface.  The city is particularly interested in knowing if the planned withdrawal rate will result in pumped water that exceeds the drinking water standard for chloride, which is 250 mg/L.  In addition, you have been asked by the city to delineate a wellfield protection zone by determining the approximate recharge area for the wellfield.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./img/exB_fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The study area consists of a 10 by 10 km area of a coastal plain aquifer system centered on the proposed wellfield (Figure 1).  The hydrogeology of the area consists of a shallow and deep aquifer, and both aquifers intersect the sea floor (Figure 2).  The two aquifers are separated by a discontinuous confining layer that thickens to the east.  The confining layer is present in the eastern part of the study area, but is absent in the western part.  A low permeability unit, which slopes downward to the east, underlies the deep aquifer and can be considered a no flow boundary.  Extensive field investigations have been performed, and the aquifer properties for the different units are summarized in the table below.  Annual average recharge was determined to be 25.4 cm/yr (10 in/yr).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./img/exB_fig2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to limitations in available property, the city has only one option for wellfield location, which is shown on the map in Figure 1.  The city is hoping to capture at least 25% of the recharge for the area, but there is an obvious concern that excessive pumping from the deep aquifer could cause the saltwater interface to move inland and contaminate the wellfield.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the geometry of the system, the pre-withdrawal conditions can be obtained by running a 2D cross-section model.  The resulting heads and salinities can then be used as initial conditions for the 3D model to evaluate interface movement in response to pumping.  Because 3D saltwater intrusion models can take a long time, across-sectional model is developed first using one row, 100 columns, and 25 model layers. The model has already been constructed for you.\n",

The data type “concentration” will be used in this visualization.  Click “OK”.  A blank box will appear.  Go to Show>solid and you will see some colors appear; however, this view still looks odd.  Why do you think that is?  Could it have something to do with the dimensions of the model?  How do you think this can be fixed?
